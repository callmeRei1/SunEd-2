                  <h2>
                      Experts agree that gradually establishing English as the second
                      language in Vietnamese schools is a challenging yet essential step
                      that the country must take.
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                      In Conclusion No. 91, regarding the continued implementation of
                      Resolution 29 of 2013 by the Party Central Committee on "fundamental
                      and comprehensive reform of education and training, meeting the
                      requirements of industrialization and modernization in the context of
                      a socialist-oriented market economy and international integration,"
                      the Politburo emphasized the need to enhance students' foreign
                      language proficiency, aiming to gradually make English the second
                      language in schools. Professor Nguyen Minh Thuyet, former Deputy
                      Chairman of the National Assembly's Committee on Culture, Education,
                      Youth, and Children, acknowledges the difficulty of this task but
                      asserts its inevitability. ​
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      "Nearly a decade ago, some ministry leaders proposed making English
                      Vietnam’s second language, given its status as the global lingua
                      franca and its critical role in international integration. As a member
                      of ASEAN, where English is the common language, Vietnam must
                      eventually adopt English as the second language in schools and, later,
                      nationwide," Thuyet explained.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      However, Thuyet highlighted that making English the official second
                      language of the country would require constitutional amendments, which
                      are beyond the government's authority. Nonetheless, the government can
                      develop strategies to establish English as the second language in
                      educational institutions. According to Article 11 of the Education
                      Law, the government is responsible for regulating the teaching and
                      learning of foreign languages within schools. One significant
                      challenge in Vietnam is the limited use of English among the general
                      population. Therefore, establishing English as the second language in
                      schools will require a long-term plan with practical, concrete steps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      "There are several critical issues to clarify, such as: What defines a
                      second language? What roles does a second language play? For ethnic
                      minority children, how does learning their mother tongue fit in? These
                      questions need to be addressed through legal documents," Thuyet noted.
                      The Prime Minister’s Decision No. 72 from 2014, which governs the
                      teaching and learning of foreign languages in schools, may need to be
                      reviewed and revised to align with Conclusion No. 91 from the
                      Politburo. For instance, the policy could be updated to include
                      teaching certain subjects in English, rather than merely promoting
                      general foreign language education. ​
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                      Professor Thuyet also suggested that authorities should determine
                      which educational levels or areas of study should first adopt English
                      instruction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      "In the short term, we could develop two parallel programs: one
                      teaching all subjects in Vietnamese and another teaching some subjects
                      (such as Math, Science, and Technology) in English, with the rest in
                      Vietnamese. Local authorities can decide which program to implement in
                      their areas. In regions with both programs, students can choose the
                      one that suits them. If a local area doesn’t offer the English-taught
                      program, students should be allowed to attend schools in other areas
                      that do," Thuyet proposed. "Even in mountainous areas, some schools
                      could begin teaching certain subjects in English. While remote regions
                      may not be able to implement this immediately, a gradual, well-planned
                      rollout is necessary. We cannot remain stagnant under the guise of
                      ‘gradual implementation’ without making actual progress." Thuyet also
                      emphasized the need for clear regulations on assessing and evaluating
                      the effectiveness of English language teaching and learning.

                  <h2>An uphill task ​</h2>
                  <p>
                      Ha Anh Phuong, an English teacher at Huong Can High School in Thanh
                      Son District, Phu Tho Province, agrees that making English the second
                      language is a necessary but challenging goal that must be pursued
                      gradually.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      "In the current context, it will take time to establish English as a
                      second language," Phuong noted. As an English teacher in a mountainous
                      area, Phuong has seen firsthand the difficulties of making English an
                      elective subject in the high school graduation exam. In many
                      provinces, English is not even a mandatory subject for entrance exams.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      "With the mindset of only studying what is tested, students,
                      especially those in mountainous areas, often neglect English if it’s
                      not on the exam. This lack of interest and motivation hinders efforts
                      to establish English as a second language, widening the gap between
                      urban and rural areas in terms of foreign language proficiency,"
                      Phuong observed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      To gradually make English the second language in schools, Phuong
                      believes that local authorities must foster a strong learning
                      environment, change assessment methods, and incorporate English into
                      entrance exams. Revising how English is tested and evaluated will
                      naturally influence how it is taught and learned. ​
                  </p>
      
                  <p>
                      Phuong also advocates for exam structures that focus more on practical
                      English skills rather than just language knowledge. This approach will
                      help students develop real-world language abilities rather than merely
                      passing tests without being able to effectively communicate in
                      English. ​
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Moreover, Phuong suggests that schools should create language-learning
                      environments that connect students with local culture. For example,
                      she often engages her students in projects like “I am Muong
                      Ethnicity,” where they produce bilingual content to preserve and
                      promote Muong culture. This includes creating Spotify playlists and
                      radio programs in both Vietnamese and English and connecting with
                      international friends to share Muong culture globally. Such activities
                      make English learning more relevant and engaging. ​
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      For ethnic minority students, Phuong emphasizes the importance of
                      distinguishing between a "foreign language" and a "second language,"
                      as their mother tongue is typically their first language, followed by
                      Vietnamese, with English as an additional language.

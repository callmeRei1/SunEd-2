          <span class="picture-cap">Director of the Department of Secondary Education Nguyen Xuan Thanh
              reported at the conference</span>
          <p>
              HÀ NỘI – The Department of International Cooperation, under the
              Ministry of Education and Training, has reported that approximately
              22,000 international students are studying at universities and
              colleges in Việt Nam for the 2023-2024 school year.
          </p>
          <p>
              Of these, nearly 4,000 students are on government-sponsored
              scholarships, while the rest are self-funded, studying under bilateral
              agreements at the institutional or local levels.
          </p>
          <p>
              The number of foreign students studying in Việt Nam has risen in
              recent years. There were 18,500 international students in the
              2020-2021 school year, 16,000 in 2021-2022 and an increase to 21,000
              in 2022-2023. ​
          </p>

              Zak Jabes Misoles Lagare, a second-year finance and accounting student
              from the Philippines at Vietnamese-German University, shared
              withtuoitre.vn what attracted him to study here.
          </p>
          <p>
              “When I toured Vietnamese-German University, I saw that it could meet
              my goals for studying in Việt Nam. I could enjoy a private life in the
              dorms, yet still have the freedom to visit family on weekends or
              whenever I wanted,” Zak said.
          </p>
          <p>
              Zak noted that most students at Vietnamese-German University study
              seriously, showcasing their talents not only in academics and research
              but also through active participation in student events and clubs.
              This creates a vibrant learning and social environment, motivating
              individual growth.
          </p>
          <p>
              He was especially impressed by the faculty's expertise and experience,
              saying they have both deep knowledge and a willingness to support
              students. Other students cite various reasons for choosing to study in
              Việt Nam. ​
          </p>
          <p>
              Park Jun Seo from South Korea, a graduate in International Business at
              the University of Economics HCM City and now pursuing a degree in
              corporate accounting, said he chose to study in Việt Nam because the
              opportunities for both education and employment seemed more accessible
              than in South Korea. He arrived in Việt Nam in 2016, taught himself
              Vietnamese, and earned a Level C certificate in a Vietnamese language
              competition in February 2017. He began his studies at the university
              in 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
              "The environment and facilities at the university are quite modern and
              the professors are excellent. I am very satisfied. Many of my peers in
              accounting and finance are very talented," he said.
          </p>
          <p>
              Meanwhile, Peng Chun Sheng from Taiwan chose to pursue a master’s
              degree in journalism at the University of Social Sciences and
              Humanities under the Việt Nam National University, HCM City due to
              personal ties to Việt Nam. ​
          </p>
          <p>
              Sheng’s maternal grandfather, who was of Chinese descent, had lived in
              Việt Nam and Sheng’s mother was born there. However, the family later
              moved to Taiwan. Sheng’s father also worked in Việt Nam for some time
              when Sheng was young. ​
          </p>
          <p>
              "Although I wasn’t born here and don’t have Vietnamese roots, I feel
              connected to Việt Nam, so I chose to study here. I also plan to work
              here long term,” Sheng said. The Ministry of Education and Training
              recognised that student exchange programmes with other countries
              promote cultural exchange, academic collaboration, and strengthen
              international friendships and global integration.
          </p>
          <p>
              Statistics show that many universities host significant numbers of
              self-funded international students. For instance, this year, HCM
              City’s Open University welcomed nearly 100 international students from
              countries like Laos, Cambodia, France, the Philippines, Myanmar and
              Ghana for undergraduate studies. ​
          </p>
          <p>
              President of HCM City’s Open University Nguyễn Minh Hà said that among
              the nearly 100 international students, most are self-funded, with only
              a few on government scholarships.
          </p>
          <p>
              Vice president of the University of Economics HCM City Bùi Quang Hùng
              noted that the number of full-time international students has steadily
              increased in recent years.
          </p>
          <p>
              Currently, over 40 international students from countries such as
              Myanmar, China, South Korea, France, New Zealand, Laos, Ukraine and
              Cambodia are enrolled in the university’s regular programmes.
          </p>
          <p>
              In 2024, the number of full-time international students increased
              compared to 2023 and previous years, with some students returning to
              pursue a second degree after completing their first. This trend
              reflects the strong interest in UEH’s programs among foreign students,
              he said. – VNS

                Minister of Education and Training Nguyễn Kim Sơn spoke to Tin Tức
                (News) newspaper about strategies for addressing key developments in
                the education sector.
            </h2>
            <p>
                The 2024-25 academic year marks a significant milestone as the 2018
                general education programme is rolled out uniformly across all twelve
                grades for the first time. It also marks the conclusion of five years
                of implementing the 2019 Education Law, with the draft Law on Teachers
                set to be debated in the National Assembly. Minister of Education and
                Training Nguyễn Kim Sơn spoke to Tin Tức (News) newspaper about
                strategies for addressing these key developments.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Could you tell us the standout achievements of the education sector in
                the 2023-24 academic year?
            </h2>
            <p>
                The 2023-24 academic year marked a decade since the implementation of
                Resolution 29. Following the Politburo's directive, the Ministry of
                Education and Training, along with key agencies, reviewed the past ten
                years. On August 12, the Politburo issued Conclusion No. 91, stressing
                the need for continued reform.
            </p>
            <p>
                This conclusion is crucial for unifying efforts in advancing
                comprehensive education reforms to meet future development needs. Last
                year, the government and Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính focused on
                early childhood education, introducing a new preschool curriculum and
                a draft resolution on universal education for children aged three to
                five.
            </p>
            <p>
                In general education, the 2018 curriculum changes have been well
                received. Local authorities have invested in these reforms, with the
                2023-2024 high school graduation exam successfully concluding as the
                last under the 2006 programme. The new exam system, starting in 2025,
                has been approved and is widely supported.
            </p>
            <p>
                The year was also notable for Việt Nam’s specialised schools, with
                national Olympic teams achieving remarkable results, including gold
                and silver medals and high rankings in international competitions.
                Vietnamese students excelled at the International Science and
                Engineering Fair, securing second prize.
            </p>
            <p>
                Higher education saw a record number of university applicants and
                significant quality improvements. Digital transformation advanced with
                the completion of educational databases and integration with the
                national population database. Increased applications for teacher
                training and improved base salaries have positively impacted
                educators.
            </p>
            <p>
                The development and review of textbooks met quality expectations, and
                increased support for teachers was well received. The academic year
                also featured major national and international sports events,
                including the successful hosting of the 13th Southeast Asian Student
                Games and the 10th National Phù Đổng Sports Festival.
            </p>
            <h2>
                What are the education sector's main priorities for the new academic
                year?
            </h2>
            <p>
                For the 2024-25 academic year, the education sector will focus on
                implementing key national policies and Party resolutions, prioritising
                educational reform through discipline, innovation and quality
                enhancement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Major goals include executing Conclusion No. 91 on education reform,
                assessing the 2018 general education programme, preparing a new
                preschool curriculum, enhancing university autonomy, and advancing
                human resources training. Emphasis will be placed on developing skills
                in semiconductor microelectronics, artificial intelligence, and cloud
                computing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MoET will advise the government on an action programme for
                Conclusion No. 91 and create its own action plan to ensure effective
                execution. The sector will also update legal documents to address
                emerging issues and improve the policy environment, with a key focus
                on finalising the draft Law on Teachers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the ministry will soon release the Việt Nam Education
                Development Strategy for 2030 and a vision for 2045, aiming to address
                current challenges and achieve greater success in the new academic
                year.
            </p>
            <h2>
                For the 2024-25 academic year, the education sector will continue
                rolling out the new curriculum in grades five, nine, and 12. This year
                also marks the first high school graduation exam conducted under the
                new curriculum. What specific directives has the MoET issued for this
                academic year?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Despite the challenges encountered during recent educational reforms,
                the process has highlighted the commitment and effort of the entire
                political system, local authorities, and the education sector. This
                year is particularly crucial, and the MoET has been preparing
                extensively. The new high school graduation exam format, which will be
                introduced in 2025, has been developed with broad consultation and
                received strong public support. Regulations for the 2025 exam are
                expected to be issued by November 2024 and are designed to be
                practical and stable for students, teachers, and schools.
            </p>
            <p>
                To ensure a smooth transition, extensive trial runs of the new exam
                format will be conducted, with local education departments prepared to
                implement these trials and address any issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                The academic year’s schedule and guidelines have been released early,
                outlining key tasks such as implementing the 2018 curriculum for final
                grades and preparing for the 2025 graduation exam.
            </p>
            <p>
                In various meetings, including those with education directors and
                sector-wide reviews, the MoET and local officials have discussed
                tasks, shared experiences, and sought solutions to challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MoET remains committed to closely monitoring and supporting local
                areas in executing key tasks for the 2024-25 academic year.

                Teacher shortages continue to affect many provinces and cities,
                particularly for those qualified to teach the new curriculum. What
                steps has the MoET taken or planned to address this issue?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Currently, there are around 1.6 million teachers nationwide. In the
                2023-24 academic year, 19,474 new teachers were recruited. However,
                rising student numbers have led to an increase in classes: 7,198 more
                at the lower secondary level (requiring 13,676 additional teachers)
                and 1,213 more at the upper secondary level (needing 2,729 more
                teachers). This has contributed to a persistent teacher shortage in
                many regions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Preliminary reports suggest that the teacher shortage for the 2024-25
                academic year will rise by 19,856, including 6,000 more needed for
                early childhood education and 13,856 for general education. The
                shortage is mainly due to the growing number of students, which has
                led to 2,327 additional groups in early childhood education and 7,150
                more classes in general education.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ministry has directed local authorities to fill all teaching
                positions and to request additional teacher training. Universities are
                being encouraged to train teachers for new subjects and ethnic
                minority languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MoET will continue to update policies and legislation to improve
                teachers' status, including presenting the draft Law on Teachers to
                the National Assembly. This law aims to create a legal framework for
                recruitment, management, and recognition of teachers and to give
                education authorities more control over teacher appointments.
            </p>
            <p>
                In collaboration with the Ministry of Home Affairs, the MoET will
                advise on staffing quotas as per Central Decision No. 72, urging
                localities to use existing quotas fully and request additional ones.
                Local authorities are also encouraged to implement supportive policies
                to ensure job security and satisfaction for teachers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recent policies, including incentives for teacher trainees and salary
                increases, have made teaching careers more appealing. Many regions
                have adopted measures to attract and retain teachers, and the draft
                Law on Teachers is designed to address these needs, representing
                significant progress in tackling the teacher shortage.
            </p>
            <h2>
                As the new academic year approaches, shortages of school places
                persist in major cities, and school infrastructure in challenging and
                flood-affected areas remains inadequate. How has the MoET addressed
                and supported localities in dealing with these issues?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Localities have recently focused on expanding school networks,
                improving infrastructure, and upgrading teaching facilities. However,
                around 15.5 per cent of classrooms nationwide remain inadequately
                built, with persistent shortages in densely populated, mountainous,
                remote, and particularly challenging areas. The availability of
                teaching equipment meeting regulatory standards is also low, at just
                50.63 per cent.
            </p>
            <p>
                To achieve the 2030 goal of upgrading all educational facilities,
                significant effort from local authorities, guided by the MoET, is
                essential. For the 2024-25 school year, local education departments
                should develop a 2025-30 plan to secure proactive investment in
                education. Localities must allocate at least 20 per cent of their
                budgets to education and leverage available policies and incentives.
            </p>

            <p>
                Key objectives include effective state budget use, continuing facility
                upgrades, eliminating temporary classrooms, and expanding classrooms
                in rapidly growing or densely populated areas. Adequate infrastructure
                and teaching equipment to support the new general education programme
                are crucial.
            </p>
            <p>
                The draft Law on Teachers, which the Ministry has developed and
                published for public consultation, is expected to be a major
                highlight. The National Assembly Standing Committee has included it in
                the 2024 legislative agenda, with initial review scheduled for October
                2024 and final approval in May 2025. This development is promising for
                the 1.6 million teachers nationwide, addressing crucial issues related
                to their livelihoods and professional development.

                As the country’s economy and society develop, the demands on education
                become increasingly rigorous. The education sector has never faced
                such significant responsibilities and challenges as it does today.
                Over the past academic year, the sector has made remarkable efforts to
                overcome numerous obstacles.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 2023-24 academic year ended on a positive note, and as we look
                forward to the new academic year, I want to acknowledge and thank the
                exceptional efforts of all education staff, including managers,
                teachers, and employees, as well as students. As we embark on this new
                academic year, I encourage everyone, managers, teachers, and staff, to
                continue their hard work with renewed dedication and innovative
                solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Building on the sector’s strong traditions, let us strive to further
                advance Vietnamese education in line with the Party’s and State’s
                goals. I wish teachers increased joy and motivation in their roles,
                and I hope students enjoy a year filled with creativity and progress.
